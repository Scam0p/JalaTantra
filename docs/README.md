# 🌱 Jalatantra: Smart Irrigation System

### 🚀 Hackathon Project – Sustainable Smart Water Irrigation

*Jalatantra* is an IoT + AI powered smart irrigation system designed to optimise water usage in agriculture.  
It predicts rainfall, monitors soil and water levels, and automates irrigation decisions in real-time.  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **IoT** → ESP32, sensors (soil moisture, water level, etc.)
- **AI** → Rainfall prediction model (Python, trained on 80 years of data)
- **Backend** → REST API to connect sensors, AI, and dashboard
- **Frontend** → Web dashboard with real-time data & Kannada language support
